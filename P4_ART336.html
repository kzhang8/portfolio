<p style="margin: 40px 200px 25px 200px">Designed a package for any mundane object! I basically have to come up with another function for any old object than its original function. Mine is a shower curtain. I wanted it to be used for a drawing tool. (swipe for more info). This project was quite expensive and took so much printing, fixing, and quite a lot of time but I learned a lot. ••• Media used: Bristol board paper, 12x18 dimensions and tabloid oversized paper, transparency paper, printing sticker paper, foam paper. Assignment: 
Find a creative use for a mundane object, turn it into a product and package it. A few examples of mundane
objects would be rock, water, paper clips, rubber bands, etc. Your concepts can be experimental, whimsical, dead serious or tongue in cheek. Ultimately, your concept should allow you to create an interesting product, name (logo/symbol) and finally an innovative package design. Depending on your concept, you may want to think of your project as a series (multiples). This project is not about sales and profit margins, yet your final
solution must have the potential to be seen in a retail store. You must determine the audience for this product and consequently where it may be seen, sold or offered.
Process: 
Select an object that truly interests you. Create concept map on a 11x14 paper. Begin research and planning
on names and possible interesting solutions. Collect any material needed for inspiration and documentation. Prepare written proposal which includes your concept, goals, why this is a good solution, and where will this product be sold. Also include how you plan to approach this formally, and why this approach is appropriate. </p>
