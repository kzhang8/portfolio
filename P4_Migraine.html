<p style="margin: 40px 200px 25px 200px">"Hey guys. Those of you who have followed me because of my clique art, I've returned! This was a bit of a struggle to finish because University kept me busy and I couldn't continue it from Spring Break until recently. Boy, let me tell you, it took me _ to finish this. Those who have been keeping up with my WIP's from my instagram stories, I asked what song I'm creating this big drawing for and those who have guessed "Migraine", you're correct! THis song is a big poem and I really admire the lyrics Tyler Joseph wrote for this song. They really jog my brain with creative juices. It really describes how when you're going through depression or anxiety, there really is something "wrong" going on in our psyches (watch videos again to accurately describe what he said about the song meaning). In my drawing, I wanted to make frames with illustrative elements TYler has of Migraine coming out of them as if they're coming to life-- it's all really chaotic and claustrophic (thus all of the details in this drawing). I decided to draw Josh Dun as the main protagonist this time for this piece. I was a bit scared to draw him in my previous clique art because of his unique face, so I hope I drew him okay in a recognizable way. THis was drawn on bristol paper 19x24" with Winson and Newton Markers, color pencils, and brush markers. I was inspired by duotoned illustrations; it was fun playing with limited colors! I'm still not familiar with coloring and colors in general, so bare with me. Stay tuned for my next drawing-- also from the Vessel album!" </p>
