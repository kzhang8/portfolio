<p style="margin: 40px 200px 25px 200px">For this project, we started with a proposal presentation including: 1) Explaining the theme and selected parts of the dialogue. 2) Showing at least 5 images related to your theme. 3) Defining boundaries: color palletes, size and form of the book, typefaces, etc. 4) Showing 5 good examples and 5 bad examples of books that contain both type and image and justifying my decision.  Then we had to make a book mock-up and concept sketches. I took the story inspired by the movie "The Babadook" and created a script from it between two people-- the widowed mother and an interviewer about her mental illness. The end result was suppose to be a dialogue book with designs that depict different lines of the script.</p>
