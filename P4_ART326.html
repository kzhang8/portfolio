<p style="margin: 40px 200px 25px 200px">1. Identify an area of personal interest.2. Conduct research to accumulate data related to your area of interest.3. Organize found data into distinct categories/groups  and then try to identify relationships, patterns as well as possible layering and separation options. 4. Sketch by hand to visualize ideas for composition and size relationships.3. After following the above steps, only then move to the screen and start designing using the software of your preference.4. Utilize typography, color and form to create compelling graphics and visuals in order to communicate your given/found data in a way that engages the viewer in the most efficient way.5. Test print/preview/prototype to get a sense of the size and composition. Always try to incorporate test printing, previewing  and prototyping into your process.6. Iterate: design, test print/preview/prototype, review, revise. Repeat.</p>

<p style="margin: 40px 200px 25px 200px">Create a set of graphic instructions or wordless diagrams for a simple everyday task such as How to Make a PBJ Sandwich, How to Iron an Oxford Shirt, How to Mow a Lawn, etc. Consider the kinds of details and nuance that can communicate in about four to eight steps. Part of your creative process should include writing out the instructions in words; even though they wonâ€™t be utilized in the final form. Let the words be a tool to organize the steps for instruction, then visualize each step.</p>

<p style="margin: 40px 200px 25px 200px">You will work in four groups of four people researching and generating data for a public space. You will observe, record phenomenas and study the environment of this public space using the AEIOU framework and generate a set of data about your chosen space. Then  you will come together as a team and after organizing and filtering all of your findings, you will design a piece that reflects on the data you have gathered. Look for patterns, phenomena, personas etc. Make sure you tell us a story about your subject. Process- Part 1: Split into four teams of four.Part 2: Observe, record and study the chosen public space. Part 3: Design a piece that reflects on the data that you have gathered.</p>

<p style="margin: 40px 200px 25px 200px">Explore the possibilities of visualizing overlapping relationships within categories of information by representing these overlapping categories visually, using typography, scale, color, line, and other cues to indicate connections and difference. Process:Compose a list of 25 music artists or groups and include the following three categories of data for each artist or group:~ Genre of music~ City, State, Country of origin~ How much you like them (ranking list)Organize and categorize this information and find the relationships between the artists/groups. Find the overlapping information and relationships. You will visualize these relationships and create informative and dynamic compositions.Part 1Focus on typography to establish and visualize these relationships. You may use color and simple geometric shapes, but they should be secondary to the typography. Explore scale, typefaces, alignment, layout, etc.Part 2Focus on geometric shapes to establish and visualize these relationships. Color, type can be used but should be secondary to the geometric shapes.Part 3Focus on color to establish and visualize these relationships. Geometric shapes, type can be used but should be secondary to the color</p>
